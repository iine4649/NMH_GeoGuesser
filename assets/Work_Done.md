Wed Sep 24 Work Done Update:

Georgii and Ethan worked on Data uploading and organization of the photos taken from around campus as well as adding coordinates of all of the images based on the location of where the image was taken both for the hard and easy category. Henry and Ethan worked on the the overall user interface of the project. Henry in particular was working on creating a display widget in order to have a map icon that allows a a program to identify the coordinates of a point selected by a user. He also worked on actually having a display show up depending on what the backend work that Shun and Eben worked on. Henry also created the option that allows for the use of either an easy mode or hard mode, changing the database that is used for the images. Shun worked on the backend in order to load the data that Georgii and Ethan put in. he then, in Utils.py worked on creating a distance calculator between the point selected by the user and the actual location. Ethan also wrote this magnificant update. :D
